# Team Subhunters - Pacman

## BHAG

You are Pacman stuck in a maze being chased by four ghosts, while collecting as many pellets as possible to escape, some pellets give Pacman the ability to fight back against the ghosts, and other fruits can help rejuvenate Pacman to escape the maze.

## Epic Stories
